The quiz logic is implemented using **React state hooks**, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Key Design Considerations
- Minimalistic UI for user-friendly interaction
- Efficient state management using React hooks
- Optimized component structure for scalability
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility
